Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,A louse and a flea kept house together and were brewing beer in an egg-shell.
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,Then the little louse fell in and burnt herself.
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,On this the little flea began to scream loudly.
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"Then said the little room-door, ""Little flea, why art thou screaming?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""Because the louse has burnt herself."""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,Then the little door began to creak.
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"On this a little broom in the corner said, ""Why art thou creaking, little door?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""Have I not reason to creak?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""The little louse has burnt herself, The little flea is weeping."""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,So the little broom began to sweep frantically.
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"Then a little cart passed by and said, ""Why art thou sweeping, little broom?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""Have I not reason to sweep?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""The little louse has burnt herself, The little flea is weeping,"
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"The little door is creaking."""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"So the little cart said, ""Then I will run,"" and began to run wildly."
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"Then said the ash-heap by which it ran, ""Why art thou running so, little cart?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""Have I not reason to run?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""The little louse has burnt herself, The little flea is weeping,"
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"The little door is creaking, The little broom is sweeping."""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"The ash-heap said, ""Then I will burn furiously,"" and began to burn in clear flames."
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"A little tree stood near the ash-heap and said, ""Ash-heap, why art thou burning?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""Have I not reason to burn?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""The little louse has burnt herself, The little flea is weeping,"
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"The little door is creaking, The little broom is sweeping,"
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"The little cart is running."""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"The little tree said, ""Then I will shake myself,"" and began to shake herself so that all her leaves fell off; a girl who came up with her water-pitcher saw that, and said, ""Little tree, why art thou shaking thyself?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""Have I not reason to shake myself?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""The little louse has burnt herself, The little flea is weeping,"
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"The little door is creaking, The little broom is sweeping,"
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"The little cart is running, The little ash-heap is burning."""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"On this the girl said, ""Then I will break my little water-pitcher,"" and she broke her little water-pitcher."
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"Then said the little spring from which ran the water, ""Girl, why art thou breaking thy water-jug?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""Have I not reason to break my water-jug?"""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""The little louse has burnt herself, The little flea is weeping,"
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"The little door is creaking, The little broom is sweeping,"
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"The little cart is running, The little ash-heap is burning,"
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"The little tree is shaking itself."""
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"""Oh, ho!"" said the spring, ""then I will begin to flow,"" and began to flow violently."
Grimms,30_the_louse_and_the_flea,"And in the water everything was drowned, the girl, the little tree, the little ash-heap, the little cart, the broom, the little door, the little flea, the little louse, all together."
