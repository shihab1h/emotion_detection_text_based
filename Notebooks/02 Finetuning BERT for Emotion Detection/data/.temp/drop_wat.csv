HCAndersen,drop_wat,OF course you know what is meant by a magnifying glass- one of those round spectacle-glasses that make everything look a hundred times bigger than it is?
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"When any one takes one of these and holds it to his eye, and looks at a drop of water from the pond yonder, he sees above a thousand wonderful creatures that are otherwise never discerned in the water."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"But there they are, and it is no delusion."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,It almost looks like a great plateful of spiders jumping about in a crowd.
HCAndersen,drop_wat,And how fierce they are!
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"They tear off each other's legs. and arms and bodies, before and behind; and yet they are merry and joyful in their way."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"Now, there once was an old man whom all the people called Kribble-Krabble, for that was his name."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"He always wanted the best of everything, and when he could not manage it otherwise, he did it by magic."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"There he sat one day, and held his magnifying-glass to his eye, and looked at a drop of water that had been taken out of a puddle by the ditch."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,But what a kribbling and krabbling was there!
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"All the thousands of little creatures hopped and sprang and tugged at one another, and ate each other up."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"""That is horrible!"" said old Kribble-Krabble."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"""Can one not persuade them to live in peace and quietness, so that each one may mind his own business?"""
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"And he thought it over and over, but it would not do, and so he had recourse to magic."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"""I must give them color, that they may be seen more plainly,"" said he; and he poured something like a little drop of red wine into the drop of water, but it was witches' blood from the lobes of the ear, the finest kind, at ninepence a drop."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,And now the wonderful little creatures were pink all over.
HCAndersen,drop_wat,It looked like a whole town of naked wild men.
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"""What have you there?"" asked another old magician, who had no name- and that was the best thing about him."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"""Yes, if you can guess what it is,"" said Kribble-Krabble, ""I'll make you a present of it."""
HCAndersen,drop_wat,But it is not so easy to find out if one does not know.
HCAndersen,drop_wat,And the magician who had no name looked through the magnifying-glass.
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"It looked really like a great town reflected there, in which all the people were running about without clothes."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,It was terrible!
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"But it was still more terrible to see how one beat and pushed the other, and bit and hacked, and tugged and mauled him."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"Those at the top were being pulled down, and those at the bottom were struggling upwards."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"""Look! look! his leg is longer than mine!"
HCAndersen,drop_wat,Bah!
HCAndersen,drop_wat,Away with it!
HCAndersen,drop_wat,There is one who has a little bruise.
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"It hurts him, but it shall hurt him still more."""
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"And they hacked away at him, and they pulled at him, and ate him up, because of the little bruise."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"And there was one sitting as still as any little maiden, and wishing only for peace and quietness."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"But now she had to come out, and they tugged at her, and pulled her about, and ate her up."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"""That's funny!"" said the magician."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"""Yes; but what do you think it is?"" said Kribble-Krabble."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"""Can you find that out?"""
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"""Why, one can see that easily enough,"" said the other."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"""That's Paris, or some other great city, for they're all alike."
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"It's a great city!"""
HCAndersen,drop_wat,"""It's a drop of puddle water!"" said Kribble-Krabble."
