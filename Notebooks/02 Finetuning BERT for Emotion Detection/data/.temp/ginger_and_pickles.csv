Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Once upon a time there was a village shop.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"The name over the window was ""Ginger and Pickles."""
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls-- Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Ginger and Pickles sold red spotty pocket handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything--except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces, hair- pins and mutton chops."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"Ginger was a yellow tomcat, and Pickles was a terrier."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,The shop was also patronized by mice--only the mice were rather afraid of Ginger.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made his mouth water."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""I cannot bear,"" said he, ""to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels."""
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""I have the same feeling about rats,"" replied Pickles, ""but it would never do to eat our customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha Twitchit's."""
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""On the contrary, they would go nowhere,"" replied Ginger gloomily."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,She did not give credit.)
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"But there is no money in what is called the ""till."""
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"Now the meaning of ""credit"" is this--when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it --she says she will pay another time."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"And Pickles makes a low bow and says, ""With pleasure, madam,"" and it is written down in a book."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being afraid of Ginger and Pickles."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,But there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a penny- worth of peppermints.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat their own goods."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,They ate them by candle- light after the shop was closed.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"I have tried in vain to get a license upon credit at the Post Office;"" said Pickles."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""The place is full of policemen."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,I met one as I was coming home.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9 for bacon."""
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,"" replied Ginger."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable to buy a dog license."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police,"" said Pickles."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""It is your own fault for being a terrier; _I_ do not require a license, and neither does Kep, the Collie dog."""
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things--"
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""Where are all the cream crackers?"""
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""You have eaten them yourself."" replied Ginger."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlor.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,They did accounts.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"They added up sums and sums, and sums."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an ounce and three- quarters of snuff since October."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?"""
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""Send in all the bills again to everybody `with compliments,'"" replied Ginger."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""Bite him, Pickles! bite him!"" spluttered Ginger behind a sugar barrel, ""he's only a German doll!"""
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Pickles barked till he was hoarse.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,But still the policeman took no notice.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,They came out of the back parlor.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a notebook!"
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,At length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was empty.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,The policeman had disappeared.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,But the envelope remained.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman?"
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"I am afraid it is a summons,"" said Pickles."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""No,"" replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, ""it is the rates and taxes, 3 pounds 19 11 3/4."" [pounds are British money, the 19 is schillings, and then pence]"
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"""This is the last straw,"" said Pickles, ""let us close the shop."""
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"They put up the shutters, and left."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,But they have not removed from the neighborhood.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,In fact some people wish they had gone further.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Ginger is living in the warren [game preserve for rabbits].
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,I do not know what occupation he pursues; he looks stout and comfortable.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Pickles is at present a game- keeper.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"But they did not keep ""self- fitting sixes""; and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a halfpenny; and she continued to refuse to give credit.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"Of course there are the tradesmen's carts--the butcher, the fishman and Timothy Baker."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"But a person cannot live on ""seed wigs"" and sponge cake and butter buns--not even when the sponge cake is as good as Timothy's!"
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but ""very snug;"" which is not the way to carry on a retail business."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to reopen the shop--""Henny's Opening Sale!"
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Grand cooperative Jumble!
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,Penny's penny prices!
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"Come buy, come try, come buy!"""
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,The poster really was most 'ticing.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,There was a rush upon the opening day.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"The shop was crammed with customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit cannisters."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,"Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless."
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.
Potter,ginger_and_pickles,There is something to please everybody.
