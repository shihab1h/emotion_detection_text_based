Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"This is a Tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green-- Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"""Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?"""
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"He bobbed up and down like a little red CHERRY, singing--"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"""Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"A little wee man, in a red red coat!"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat; If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat."""
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said--"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"""Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?"""
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing--"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"""Old Mr. B!"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,Riddle-me-ree!
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"Hitty Pitty within the wall, Hitty Pitty without the wall; If you touch Hitty Pitty, Hitty Pitty will bite you!"""
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,He shut the door in Nutkin's face.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"Presently a little thread of blue SMOKE from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"""A house full, a hole full!"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"And you cannot gather a bowl-full!"""
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"But Nutkin gathered oak-apples-- yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"He ran in front, singing--"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"""The man in the wilderness said to me, `How may strawberries grow in the sea?'"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"I answered him as I thought good-- `As many red herrings as grow in the wood.""'"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in PLUM-PUDDING for Old Brown."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dockleaf, fastened with a pine-needle- pin."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever--
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"""Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree!"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"Flour of England, fruit of Spain, Met together in a shower of rain; Put in a bag tied round with a string, If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a ring!"""
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin's pin-cushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle-pins."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,They had stolen it out of a bumble BEES' nest on the tippity top of the hill.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing--"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"""Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz!"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,Hum-a-bum buzz!
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"As I went over Tipple-tine I met a flock of bonny swine; Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"They were the very bonniest swine That e'er went over the Tipple-tine."""
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,But he ate up the honey!
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid EGG in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"""Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck, With a white counterpane round his neck, Forty doctors and forty wrights, Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!"""
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,But still he did not speak.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,Nutkin became more and more impertinent--
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"""Old Mr. B!"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,Old Mr. B!
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's kitchen door; All the King's horses, and all the King's men, Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore, Off the King's kitchen door!"""
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,Nutkin danced up and down like a SUNBEAM; but still Old Brown said nothing at all.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,Nutkin began again--
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"""Authur O'Bower has broken his band, He comes roaring up the land!"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"The King of Scots with all his power, Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!"""
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the WIND, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,. . .
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud ""Squeak!"""
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree-- there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,* * * * * * * *
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,BUT NUTKIN WAS IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET!
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,This looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"Old Brown carried Nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but Nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase, and escaped out of the attic window."
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--"
Potter,he_tale_of_squirrel_nutkinMANCORR,"""Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k!"""
