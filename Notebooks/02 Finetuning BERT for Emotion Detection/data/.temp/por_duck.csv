HCAndersen,por_duck,"A DUCK once arrived from Portugal, but there were some who said she came from Spain, which is almost the same thing."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"At all events, she was called the ""Portuguese,"" and she laid eggs, was killed, and cooked, and there was an end of her."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"But the ducklings which crept forth from the eggs were also called ""Portuguese,"" and about that there may be some question."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"But of all the family one only remained in the duckyard, which may be called a farmyard, as the chickens were admitted, and the cock strutted about in a very hostile manner."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""He annoys me with his loud crowing,"" said the Portuguese duck; ""but, still, he's a handsome bird, there's no denying that, although he's not a drake."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"He ought to moderate his voice, like those little birds who are singing in the lime-trees over there in our neighbor's garden, but that is an art only acquired in polite society."
HCAndersen,por_duck,How sweetly they sing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to them!
HCAndersen,por_duck,I call it Portuguese singing.
HCAndersen,por_duck,"If I had only such a little singing-bird, I'd be kind and good as a mother to him, for it's in my nature, in my Portuguese blood."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"While she was speaking, one of the little singing-birds came tumbling head over heels from the roof into the yard."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"The cat was after him, but he had escaped from her with a broken wing, and so came tumbling into the yard."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""That's just like the cat, she's a villain,"" said the Portuguese duck."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""I remember her ways when I had children of my own."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"How can such a creature be allowed to live, and wander about upon the roofs."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"I don't think they allow such things in Portugal."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"She pitied the little singing-bird, and so did all the other ducks who were not Portuguese."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Poor little creature!"" they said, one after another, as they came up."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""We can't sing, certainly; but we have a sounding-board, or something of the kind, within us; we can feel that, though we don't talk about it."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""But I can talk,"" said the Portuguese duck; ""and I'll do something for the little fellow; it's my duty;"" and she stepped into the water-trough, and beat her wings upon the water so strongly that the bird was nearly drowned by a shower-bath; but the duck meant it kindly."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""That is a good deed,"" she said; ""I hope the others will take example by it."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Tweet, tweet!"" said the little bird, for one of his wings being broken, he found it difficult to shake himself; but he quite understood that the bath was meant kindly, and he said, ""You are very kind-hearted, madam;"" but he did not wish for a second bath."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""I have never thought about my heart,"" replied the Portuguese duck, ""but I know that I love all my fellow-creatures, except the cat, and nobody can expect me to love her, for she ate up two of my ducklings."
HCAndersen,por_duck,But pray make yourself at home; it is easy to make one's self comfortable.
HCAndersen,por_duck,"I am myself from a foreign country, as you may see by my feathery dress."
HCAndersen,por_duck,My drake is a native of these parts; he's not of my race; but I am not proud on that account.
HCAndersen,por_duck,"If any one here can understand you, I may say positively I am that person."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""She's quite full of 'Portulak,'"" said a little common duck, who was witty."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"All the common ducks considered the word ""Portulak"" a good joke, for it sounded like Portugal."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"They nudged each other, and said, ""Quack! that was witty!"""
HCAndersen,por_duck,Then the other ducks began to notice the little bird.
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""The Portuguese had certainly a great flow of language,"" they said to the little bird."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""For our part we don't care to fill our beaks with such long words, but we sympathize with you quite as much."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"If we don't do anything else, we can walk about with you everywhere, and we think that is the best thing we can do."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""You have a lovely voice,"" said one of the eldest ducks; ""it must be great satisfaction to you to be able to give so much pleasure as you do."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"I am certainly no judge of your singing so I keep my beak shut, which is better than talking nonsense, as others do."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Don't plague him so, interposed the Portuguese duck; ""he requires rest and nursing."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"My little singing-bird do you wish me to prepare another bath for you?"""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Oh, no! no! pray let me dry,"" implored the little bird."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""The water-cure is the only remedy for me, when I am not well,"" said the Portuguese."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Amusement, too, is very beneficial."
HCAndersen,por_duck,The fowls from the neighborhood will soon be here to pay you a visit.
HCAndersen,por_duck,"There are two Cochin Chinese amongst them; they wear feathers on their legs, and are well educated."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"They have been brought from a great distance, and consequently I treat them with greater respect than I do the others."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"Then the fowls arrived, and the cock was polite enough to-day to keep from being rude."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""You are a real songster,"" he said, ""you do as much with your little voice as it is possible to do; but there requires more noise and shrillness in any one who wishes it to be known who he is."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,The two Chinese were quite enchanted with the appearance of the singing-bird.
HCAndersen,por_duck,"His feathers had been much ruffled by his bath, so that he seemed to them quite like a tiny Chinese fowl."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""He's charming,"" they said to each other, and began a conversation with him in whispers, using the most aristocratic Chinese dialect: ""We are of the same race as yourself,"" they said."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""The ducks, even the Portuguese, are all aquatic birds, as you must have noticed."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"You do not know us yet,- very few know us, or give themselves the trouble to make our acquaintance, not even any of the fowls, though we are born to occupy a higher grade in society than most of them."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"But that does not disturb us, we quietly go on in our own way among the rest, whose ideas are certainly not ours; for we look at the bright side of things, and only speak what is good, although that is sometimes very difficult to find where none exists."
HCAndersen,por_duck,Except ourselves and the cock there is not one in the yard who can be called talented or polite.
HCAndersen,por_duck,"It cannot even be said of the ducks, and we warn you, little bird, not to trust that one yonder, with the short tail feathers, for she is cunning; that curiously marked one, with the crooked stripes on her wings, is a mischief-maker, and never lets any one have the last word, though she is always in the wrong."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"That fat duck yonder speaks evil of every one, and that is against our principles."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"If we have nothing good to tell, we close our beaks."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"The Portuguese is the only one who has had any education, and with whom we can associate, but she is passionate, and talks too much about 'Portugal.'"""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""I wonder what those two Chinese are whispering about,"" whispered one duck to another; ""they are always doing it, and it annoys me."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"We never speak to them."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"Now the drake came up, and he thought the little singing-bird was a sparrow."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Well, I don't understand the difference,"" he said; ""it appears to me all the same."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"He's only a plaything, and if people will have playthings, why let them, I say."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Don't take any notice of what he says,"" whispered the Portuguese; ""he's very well in matters of business, and with him business is placed before everything."
HCAndersen,por_duck,But now I shall lie down and have a little rest.
HCAndersen,por_duck,"It is a duty we owe to ourselves that we may be nice and fat when we come to be embalmed with sage and onions and apples."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"So she laid herself down in the sun and winked with one eye; she had a very comfortable place, and felt so comfortable that she fell asleep."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"The little singing-bird busied himself for some time with his broken wing, and at last he lay down, too, quite close to his protectress."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"The sun shone warm and bright, and he found out that it was a very good place."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"But the fowls of the neighborhood were all awake, and, to tell the truth, they had paid a visit to the duckyard, simply and solely to find food for themselves."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"The Chinese were the first to leave, and the other fowls soon followed them."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"The witty little duck said of the Portuguese, that the old lady was getting quite a ""doting ducky,"" All the other ducks laughed at this."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Doting ducky,"" they whispered."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Oh, that's too 'witty!'"""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"And then they repeated the former joke about ""Portulak,"" and declared it was most amusing."
HCAndersen,por_duck,Then they all lay down to have a nap.
HCAndersen,por_duck,"They had been lying asleep for some time, when suddenly something was thrown into the yard for them to eat."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"It came down with such a bang, that the whole company started up and clapped their wings."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"The Portuguese awoke too, and rushed over to the other side: in so doing she trod upon the little singing-bird."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Tweet,"" he cried; ""you trod very hard upon me, madam."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Well, then, why do you lie in my way?"" she retorted, ""you must not be so touchy."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"I have nerves of my own, but I do not cry 'tweet.'"""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Don't be angry,"" said the little bird; ""the 'tweet' slipped out of my beak unawares."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"The Portuguese did not listen to him, but began eating as fast as she could, and made a good meal."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"When she had finished, she lay down again, and the little bird, who wished to be amiable, began to sing,-"
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Chirp and twitter, The dew-drops glitter, In the hours of sunny spring, I'll sing my best, Till I go to rest, With my head behind my wing."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Now I want rest after my dinner,"" said the Portuguese; ""you must conform to the rules of the house while you are here."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"I want to sleep now."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"The little bird was quite taken aback, for he meant it kindly."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"When madam awoke afterwards, there he stood before her with a little corn he had found, and laid it at her feet; but as she had not slept well, she was naturally in a bad temper."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Give that to a chicken,"" she said, ""and don't be always standing in my way."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Why are you angry with me?"" replied the little singing-bird, ""what have I done?"""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Done!"" repeated the Portuguese duck, ""your mode of expressing yourself is not very polite."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"I must call your attention to that fact."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""It was sunshine here yesterday,"" said the little bird, ""but to-day it is cloudy and the air is close."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""You know very little about the weather, I fancy,"" she retorted, ""the day is not over yet."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"Don't stand there, looking so stupid."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""But you are looking at me just as the wicked eyes looked when I fell into the yard yesterday."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Impertinent creature!"" exclaimed the Portuguese duck: ""would you compare me with the cat- that beast of prey?"
HCAndersen,por_duck,There's not a drop of malicious blood in me.
HCAndersen,por_duck,"I've taken your part, and now I'll teach you better manners."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"So saying, she made a bite at the little singing-bird's head, and he fell dead on the ground."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Now whatever is the meaning of this?"""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""she said; ""could he not bear even such a little peck as I gave him?"
HCAndersen,por_duck,Then certainly he was not made for this world.
HCAndersen,por_duck,"I've been like a mother to him, I know that, for I've a good heart."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"Then the cock from the neighboring yard stuck his head in, and crowed with steam-engine power."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""You'll kill me with your crowing,"" she cried, ""it's all your fault."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"He's lost his life, and I'm very near losing mine."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""There's not much of him lying there,"" observed the cock."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Speak of him with respect,"" said the Portuguese duck, ""for he had manners and education, and he could sing."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"He was affectionate and gentle, and that is as rare a quality in animals as in those who call themselves human beings."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,Then all the ducks came crowding round the little dead bird.
HCAndersen,por_duck,"Ducks have strong passions, whether they feel envy or pity."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"There was nothing to envy here, so they all showed a great deal of pity, even the two Chinese."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""We shall never have another singing-bird again amongst us; he was almost a Chinese,"" they whispered, and then they wept with such a noisy, clucking sound, that all the other fowls clucked too, but the ducks went about with redder eyes afterwards."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""We have hearts of our own,"" they said, ""nobody can deny that."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Hearts!"" repeated the Portuguese, ""indeed you have, almost as tender as the ducks in Portugal."""
HCAndersen,por_duck,"""Let us think of getting something to satisfy our hunger,"" said the drake, that's the most important business."
HCAndersen,por_duck,"If one of our toys is broken, why we have plenty more."""
