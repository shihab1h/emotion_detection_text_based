Grimms,second_story,"When old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him."
Grimms,second_story,"The wolf greeted her, and said:"
Grimms,second_story,"""Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit, How comes it that alone you sit?"
Grimms,second_story,"What are you making good?"""
Grimms,second_story,The cat replied:
Grimms,second_story,"""In milk I""m breaking bread so sweet, Will you be my guest, and eat?"""
Grimms,second_story,"""No, thank you, Mrs Cat,"" answered the wolf."
Grimms,second_story,"""Is Mrs Fox not at home?"""
Grimms,second_story,The cat said:
Grimms,second_story,"""She sits upstairs in her room, Bewailing her sorrowful doom, Bewailing her trouble so sore, For old Mr Fox is no more."""
Grimms,second_story,The wolf answered:
Grimms,second_story,"""If she""s in want of a husband now, Then will it please her to step below?"""
Grimms,second_story,"The cat runs quickly up the stair, And lets her tail fly here and there, Until she comes to the parlour door."
Grimms,second_story,"With her five gold rings at the door she knocks: ""Are you within, good Mistress Fox?"
Grimms,second_story,"If you""re in want of a husband now, Then will it please you to step below?"
Grimms,second_story,"Mrs Fox asked: ""Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed mouth?"""
Grimms,second_story,"""No,"" answered the cat."
Grimms,second_story,"""Then he won""t do for me."""
Grimms,second_story,"When the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and all the beasts of the forest, one after the other."
Grimms,second_story,"But one of the good qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the cat had continually to send the suitors away."
Grimms,second_story,At length came a young fox.
Grimms,second_story,"Then Mrs Fox said: ""Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a little pointed mouth?"""
Grimms,second_story,"""Yes,"" said the cat, ""he has."""
Grimms,second_story,"""Then let him come upstairs,"" said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding feast."
Grimms,second_story,"""Sweep me the room as clean as you can, Up with the window, fling out my old man!"
Grimms,second_story,"For many a fine fat mouse he brought, Yet of his wife he never thought, But ate up every one he caught."""
Grimms,second_story,"Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still."
