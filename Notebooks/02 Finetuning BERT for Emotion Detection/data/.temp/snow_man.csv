HCAndersen,snow_man,"""IT is so delightfully cold,"" said the Snow Man, ""that it makes my whole body crackle."
HCAndersen,snow_man,This is just the kind of wind to blow life into one.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"How that great red thing up there is staring at me!"""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"He meant the sun, who was just setting."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""It shall not make me wink."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"I shall manage to keep the pieces."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"He had two triangular pieces of tile in his head, instead of eyes; his mouth was made of an old broken rake, and was, of course, furnished with teeth."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"He had been brought into existence amidst the joyous shouts of boys, the jingling of sleigh-bells, and the slashing of whips."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"The sun went down, and the full moon rose, large, round, and clear, shining in the deep blue."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""There it comes again, from the other side,"" said the Snow Man, who supposed the sun was showing himself once more."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Ah, I have cured him of staring, though; now he may hang up there, and shine, that I may see myself."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"If I only knew how to manage to move away from this place,- I should so like to move."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"If I could, I would slide along yonder on the ice, as I have seen the boys do; but I don't understand how; I don't even know how to run."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Away, away,"" barked the old yard-dog."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"He was quite hoarse, and could not pronounce ""Bow wow"" properly."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"He had once been an indoor dog, and lay by the fire, and he had been hoarse ever since."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""The sun will make you run some day."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"I saw him, last winter, make your predecessor run, and his predecessor before him."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Away, away, they all have to go."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""I don't understand you, comrade,"" said the Snow Man."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Is that thing up yonder to teach me to run?"
HCAndersen,snow_man,"I saw it running itself a little while ago, and now it has come creeping up from the other side."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""You know nothing at all,"" replied the yard-dog; ""but then, you've only lately been patched up."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"What you see yonder is the moon, and the one before it was the sun."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"It will come again to-morrow, and most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by the well; for I think the weather is going to change."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"I can feel such pricks and stabs in my left leg; I am sure there is going to be a change."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""I don't understand him,"" said the Snow Man to himself; ""but I have a feeling that he is talking of something very disagreeable."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"The one who stared so just now, and whom he calls the sun, is not my friend; I can feel that too."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Away, away,"" barked the yard-dog, and then he turned round three times, and crept into his kennel to sleep."
HCAndersen,snow_man,There was really a change in the weather.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Towards morning, a thick fog covered the whole country round, and a keen wind arose, so that the cold seemed to freeze one's bones; but when the sun rose, the sight was splendid."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Trees and bushes were covered with hoar frost, and looked like a forest of white coral; while on every twig glittered frozen dew-drops."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"The many delicate forms concealed in summer by luxuriant foliage, were now clearly defined, and looked like glittering lace-work."
HCAndersen,snow_man,From every twig glistened a white radiance.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"The birch, waving in the wind, looked full of life, like trees in summer; and its appearance was wondrously beautiful."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"And where the sun shone, how everything glittered and sparkled, as if diamond dust had been strewn about; while the snowy carpet of the earth appeared as if covered with diamonds, from which countless lights gleamed, whiter than even the snow itself."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""This is really beautiful,"" said a young girl, who had come into the garden with a young man; and they both stood still near the Snow Man, and contemplated the glittering scene."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight,"" she exclaimed, while her eyes sparkled."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""And we can't have such a fellow as this in the summer time,"" replied the young man, pointing to the Snow Man; ""he is capital."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"The girl laughed, and nodded at the Snow Man, and then tripped away over the snow with her friend."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"The snow creaked and crackled beneath her feet, as if she had been treading on starch."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Who are these two?"" asked the Snow Man of the yard-dog."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""You have been here longer than I have; do you know them?"""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Of course I know them,"" replied the yard-dog; ""she has stroked my back many times, and he has given me a bone of meat."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"I never bite those two."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""But what are they?"" asked the Snow Man."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""They are lovers,"" he replied; ""they will go and live in the same kennel by-and-by, and gnaw at the same bone."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Away, away!"""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Are they the same kind of beings as you and I?"" asked the Snow Man."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Well, they belong to the same master,"" retorted the yard-dog."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Certainly people who were only born yesterday know very little."
HCAndersen,snow_man,I can see that in you.
HCAndersen,snow_man,I have age and experience.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"I know every one here in the house, and I know there was once a time when I did not lie out here in the cold, fastened to a chain."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Away, away!"""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""The cold is delightful,"" said the Snow Man; ""but do tell me tell me; only you must not clank your chain so; for it jars all through me when you do that."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Away, away!"" barked the yard-dog; ""I'll tell you; they said I was a pretty little fellow once; then I used to lie in a velvet-covered chair, up at the master's house, and sit in the mistress's lap."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"They used to kiss my nose, and wipe my paws with an embroidered handkerchief, and I was called 'Ami, dear Ami, sweet Ami.'"
HCAndersen,snow_man,"But after a while I grew too big for them, and they sent me away to the housekeeper's room; so I came to live on the lower story."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"You can look into the room from where you stand, and see where I was master once; for I was indeed master to the housekeeper."
HCAndersen,snow_man,It was certainly a smaller room than those up stairs; but I was more comfortable; for I was not being continually taken hold of and pulled about by the children as I had been.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"I received quite as good food, or even better."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"I had my own cushion, and there was a stove- it is the finest thing in the world at this season of the year."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"I used to go under the stove, and lie down quite beneath it."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Ah, I still dream of that stove."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Away, away!"""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Does a stove look beautiful?"" asked the Snow Man, ""is it at all like me?"""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""It is just the reverse of you,' said the dog; ""it's as black as a crow, and has a long neck and a brass knob; it eats firewood, so that fire spurts out of its mouth."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"We should keep on one side, or under it, to be comfortable."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"You can see it through the window, from where you stand."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Then the Snow Man looked, and saw a bright polished thing with a brazen knob, and fire gleaming from the lower part of it."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"The Snow Man felt quite a strange sensation come over him; it was very odd, he knew not what it meant, and he could not account for it."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"But there are people who are not men of snow, who understand what it is."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""'And why did you leave her?"" asked the Snow Man, for it seemed to him that the stove must be of the female sex."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""How could you give up such a comfortable place?"""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""I was obliged,"" replied the yard-dog."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""They turned me out of doors, and chained me up here."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"I had bitten the youngest of my master's sons in the leg, because he kicked away the bone I was gnawing."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"'Bone for bone,' I thought; but they were so angry, and from that time I have been fastened with a chain, and lost my bone."
HCAndersen,snow_man,Don't you hear how hoarse I am.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Away, away!"
HCAndersen,snow_man,I can't talk any more like other dogs.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Away, away, that is the end of it all."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,But the Snow Man was no longer listening.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"He was looking into the housekeeper's room on the lower storey; where the stove stood on its four iron legs, looking about the same size as the Snow Man himself."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""What a strange crackling I feel within me,"" he said."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Shall I ever get in there?"
HCAndersen,snow_man,"It is an innocent wish, and innocent wishes are sure to be fulfilled."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"I must go in there and lean against her, even if I have to break the window."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""You must never go in there,"" said the yard-dog, ""for if you approach the stove, you'll melt away, away."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""I might as well go,"" said the Snow Man, ""for I think I am breaking up as it is."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"During the whole day the Snow Man stood looking in through the window, and in the twilight hour the room became still more inviting, for from the stove came a gentle glow, not like the sun or the moon; no, only the bright light which gleams from a stove when it has been well fed."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"When the door of the stove was opened, the flames darted out of its mouth; this is customary with all stoves."
HCAndersen,snow_man,The light of the flames fell directly on the face and breast of the Snow Man with a ruddy gleam.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""I can endure it no longer,"" said he; ""how beautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue?"""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"The night was long, but did not appear so to the Snow Man, who stood there enjoying his own reflections, and crackling with the cold."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"In the morning, the window-panes of the housekeeper's room were covered with ice."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"They were the most beautiful ice-flowers any Snow Man could desire, but they concealed the stove."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"These window-panes would not thaw, and he could see nothing of the stove, which he pictured to himself, as if it had been a lovely human being."
HCAndersen,snow_man,The snow crackled and the wind whistled around him; it was just the kind of frosty weather a Snow Man might thoroughly enjoy.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"But he did not enjoy it; how, indeed, could he enjoy anything when he was ""stove sick?"""
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""That is terrible disease for a Snow Man,"" said the yard-dog; ""I have suffered from it myself, but I got over it."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Away, away,"" he barked and then he added, ""the weather is going to change."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,And the weather did change; it began to thaw.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"As the warmth increased, the Snow Man decreased."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"He said nothing and made no complaint, which is a sure sign."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"One morning he broke, and sunk down altogether; and, behold, where he had stood, something like a broomstick remained sticking up in the ground."
HCAndersen,snow_man,It was the pole round which the boys had built him up.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Ah, now I understand why he had such a great longing for the stove,"" said the yard-dog."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Why, there's the shovel that is used for cleaning out the stove, fastened to the pole."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,The Snow Man had a stove scraper in his body; that was what moved him so.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""But it's all over now."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Away, away."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,And soon the winter passed.
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Away, away,"" barked the hoarse yard-dog."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"But the girls in the house sang,"
HCAndersen,snow_man,"""Come from your fragrant home, green thyme; Stretch your soft branches, willow-tree; The months are bringing the sweet spring-time, When the lark in the sky sings joyfully."
HCAndersen,snow_man,"Come gentle sun, while the cuckoo sings, And I'll mock his note in my wanderings."""
HCAndersen,snow_man,And nobody thought any more of the Snow Man.
