Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to herself: ""He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the world,"" she spoke to him in a friendly way."
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"""Good day, dear Mr Fox, how are you?"
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,How is all with you?
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"How are you getting on in these hard times?"""
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not."
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"At last he said: ""Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of?"
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on?
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,What have you learnt?
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"How many arts do you understand?"""
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"""I understand but one,"" replied the cat, modestly."
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"""What art is that?"" asked the fox."
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"""When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself."""
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"""Is that all?"" said the fox."
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"""I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning."
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will teach you how people get away from the hounds."""
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,Just then came a hunter with four dogs.
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her."
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"""Open your sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,"" cried the cat to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him fast."
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"""Ah, Mr Fox,"" cried the cat."
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"""You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch!"
Grimms,the_fox_and_the_cat,"Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life."""
