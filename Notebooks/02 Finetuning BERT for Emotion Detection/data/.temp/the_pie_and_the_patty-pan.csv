Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Pussy-cat sits by the fire--how should she be fair?
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"In walks the little dog--says ""Pussy are you there?"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,How do you do Mistress Pussy?
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Mistress Pussy, how do you do?"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I thank you kindly, little dog, I fare as well as you!"" [Old Rhyme]"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Once upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess to tea."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Come in good time, my dear Duchess,"" said Ribby's letter, ""and we will have something so very nice."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,I am baking it in a pie-dish--a pie-dish with a pink rim.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,You never tasted anything so good!
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"And YOU shall eat it all! _I_ will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!"" wrote Ribby."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby,"" wrote Duchess; and then at the end she added--""I hope it isn't mouse?"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out ""isn't mouse"" and changed it to ""I hope it will be fine,"" and she gave her letter to the postman."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's letter over and over again."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse!"" said Duchess to herself--""I really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse pie."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,And MY pie was going to be veal and ham.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"A pink and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's."""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Oh what a good idea!"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come--she popped HER pie into the oven."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""The top oven bakes too quickly,"" said Ribby to herself."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Then she went out with a can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"When Ribby had laid the table she went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"And just at the same time, Duchess came out of HER house, at the other end of the village."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Ribby met Duchess half-way down the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight--she simply ran!
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Straight away to Ribby's house!
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Then she went home.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,But there was nobody there.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was NOT in the oven when I put mine in!"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,And I can't find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,I put MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"I could not turn any of the other handles; I think that they are all shams,"" said Duchess, ""but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse!"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,I cannot think what she has done with it?
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and passed the time until the clock struck four.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Ribby--having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder--went upstairs to change her dress.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the hob."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"She peeped again into the BOTTOM oven, the pie had become a lovely brown, and it was steaming hot."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I am glad I used the BOTTOM oven,"" said Ribby, ""the top one would certainly have been very much too hot."""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little tap-tappity."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Is Mrs. Ribston at home?"" inquired Duchess in the porch."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Come in! and how do you do, my dear Duchess?"" cried Ribby."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I hope I see you well?"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Quite well, I thank you, and how do YOU do, my dear Ribby?"" said Duchess."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Oh, what lovely flowers!"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Yes, it is mouse and bacon!"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I think it wants another five minutes,"" said Ribby."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Just a shade longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Do you take sugar, my dear Duchess?"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Oh yes, please! my dear Ribby; and may I have a lump upon my nose?"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""With pleasure, my dear Duchess."""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed--
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""How good that pie smells!"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"I do love veal and ham--I mean to say mouse and bacon--"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea- table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Duchess came out from under the table-cloth munching sugar, and sat up on a chair."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and marmalade,"" said Ribby."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I think""--(thought Duchess to herself)--""I THINK it would be wiser if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,What very small fine pieces it has cooked into!
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a quicker oven than my own."""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,The pie-dish was emptying rapidly!
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Duchess had had four helps already, and was fumbling with the spoon."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""A little more bacon, my dear Duchess?"" said Ribby."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was only feeling for the patty-pan."""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""The patty pan that held up the pie-crust,"" said Duchess, blushing under her black coat."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear Duchess,"" said Ribby; ""I don't think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse."""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Duchess fumbled with the spoon-- ""I can't find it!"" she said anxiously."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""There isn't a patty-pan,"" said Ribby, looking perplexed."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where can it have gone to?"" said Duchess."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of the pie-dish."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard."""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Duchess set up a howl.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I shall die!"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,I shall die!
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,I have swallowed a patty-pan!
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Oh, my dear Ribby, I do feel so ill!"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""It is impossible, my dear Duchess; there was not a patty-pan."""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Yes there WAS, my dear Ribby, I am sure I have swallowed it!"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear Duchess; where do you think you feel it?"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Oh I do feel so ill ALL OVER me, my dear Ribby."""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Shall I run for the doctor?"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Oh yes, yes! fetch Dr. Maggotty, my dear Ribby: he is a Pie himself, he will certainly understand."""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,She found him at the smithy.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Dr. Maggotty hopped so fast that Ribby had to run.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,It was most conspicuous.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,All the village could see that Ribby was fetching the doctor.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"But while Ribby had been hunting for the doctor--a curious thing had happened to Duchess, who had been left by herself, sitting before the fire, sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""How COULD I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"The fire crackled and danced, and something sizz-z-zled!"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Duchess started!
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"She opened the door of the TOP oven;--out came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie,-- and through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty-pan!"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Duchess drew a long breath--
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Then I must have been eating MOUSE!"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,. . .
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,No wonder I feel ill.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,. . .
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"But perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Duchess reflected--""What a very awkward thing to have to explain to Ribby!"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,I think I will put MY pie in the back-yard and say nothing about it.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"When I go home, I will run round and take it away."""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"She put it outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I am feeling very much better,"" said Duchess, waking up with a jump."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I am truly glad to hear it!"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"He has brought you a pill, my dear Duchess!"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I think I should feel QUITE well if he only felt my pulse,"" said Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in his beak."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""It is only a bread pill, you had much better take it; drink a little milk, my dear Duchess!"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby,"" said Duchess."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Do you not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?"""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"""Perhaps it might be wise, my dear Duchess."""
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started home."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Half-way up the lane she stopped and looked back; Ribby had gone in and shut her door.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round to the back of Ribby's house, and peeped into the yard."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"The jackdaws were eating piecrust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty-pan."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly!
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"When Ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea-things, she found a pink and white pie-dish lying smashed in the middle of the yard."
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Ribby stared with amazement-- ""Did you ever see the like! so there really WAS a patty-pan?"
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,. . .
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,But MY patty-pans are all in the kitchen cupboard.
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,Well I never did!
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,. . .
Potter,the_pie_and_the_patty-pan,"Next time I want to give a party--I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!"""
