Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Once upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night-- especially cheese and bacon."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted and mewed dreadfully.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"They patted it with their little soft paws--""Shall we make dear little muffins?"" said Mittens to Moppet."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Mittens ran away to the dairy and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Mr. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully--""Come in, Cousin Ribby, come in, and sit ye down!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,"" said Tabitha, shedding tears."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the rats have got him."""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,She wiped her eyes with her apron.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Where have you looked for him?"""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""All over the house!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,The rats are too many for me.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"What a thing it is to have an unruly family!"" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him, too!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"What is all that soot in the fender?"""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""The chimney wants sweeping-- Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and Mittens are gone!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""They have both got out of the cupboard!"""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella and they rummaged in cupboards.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They even fetched a candle and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Yes, it is infested with rats,"" said Tabitha tearfully."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old rat-- Cousin Ribby.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby,"" said Tabitha."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,But there was nothing to be seen.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They returned to the kitchen.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Here's one of your kittens at least,"" said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,She seemed to be in a terrible fright.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Oh!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Mother, Mother,"" said Moppet, ""there's been an old woman rat in the kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!"""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,The two cats ran to look at the dough pan.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Which way did she go, Moppet?"""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They went into the dairy.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"They tipped over the jar, and she scrambled out."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Oh, Mother, Mother!"" said Mittens--"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Oh!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy--a dreadful 'normous big rat, Mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and the rolling pin."""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""A rolling pin and butter!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Oh, my poor son Thomas!"" exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""A rolling pin?"" said Ribby."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?"""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,"" said Ribby."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw."""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Now, this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,It was a big old- fashioned fireplace.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""I cannot go back."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket."""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,The chimney was a very big old- fashioned one.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Tom Kitten was getting very frightened!
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"He climbed up, and up, and up."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Then he waded sideways through inches of soot.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,He was like a little sweep himself.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,It was most confusing in the dark.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,One flue seemed to lead into another.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,There were some mutton bones lying about.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""This seems funny,"" said Tom Kitten."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney?"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,I wish I had never come!
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,And what a funny smell?
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"It is something like mouse, only dreadfully strong."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"It makes me sneeze,"" said Tom Kitten."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,He squeezed through the hole in the wall and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him, he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?"" said the rat, chattering his teeth."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Please, sir, the chimney wants sweeping,"" said poor Tom Kitten."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Anna Maria!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Anna Maria!"" squeaked the rat."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,. .
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,". . . his coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Anna Maria did the tying.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,The old rat watched her and took snuff.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Anna Maria,"" said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel Whiskers), ""Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner."""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""It requires dough and a pat of butter and a rolling pin,"" said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""No,"" said Samuel Whiskers, ""make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs."""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Nonsense!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Butter and dough,"" replied Anna Maria."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,He did not meet anybody.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,He made a second journey for the rolling pin.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were too busy lighting the candle to look into the chest."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They did not see him.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Anna Maria went down by way of skirting board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,She borrowed a small saucer and scooped up the dough with her paws.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,She did not observe Moppet.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"But his mouth was full of soot and cobwebs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Except a spider who came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate bluebottles.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,It did not offer to assist him.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?"" inquired Samuel Whiskers."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,She laid hold of his ears.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Tom Kitten bit and spit, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling pin went roly-poly, roly; roly-poly, roly."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,The rats each held an end.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""His tail is sticking out!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria."""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""I fetched as much as I could carry,"" replied Anna Maria."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""I do not think""--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten--""I do NOT think it will be a good pudding."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"It smells sooty."""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Anna Maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw, and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,The rats dropped the rolling pin and listened attentively.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property--and other people's--and depart at once."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary."""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane,"" said Anna Maria."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"""I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney."""
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up-- there was nobody here under the floor except the rolling pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling!
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"Then he nailed the plank down again and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,The cat family had quite recovered.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They invited him to stay to dinner.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheelbarrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen coops."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the land from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheelbarrow, which looked very much like mine."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,I am sure _I_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheelbarrow!
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They went into the barn and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the haymow.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"There are rats, and rats, and rats in his barn!"
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"They eat up the chicken food, and steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers-- children and grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,There is no end to them!
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,They charge so much a dozen and earn their living very comfortably.
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,"They hang up the rats' tails in a row on the barn door, to show how many they have caught--dozens and dozens of them."
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face anything that is bigger than--
Potter,the_roly-poly_pudding,A Mouse.
