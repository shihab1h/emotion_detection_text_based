Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet; she thinks she has heard a mouse!
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,This is the Mouse peeping out behind the cupboard and making fun of Miss Moppet.
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,He is not afraid of a kitten.
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,This is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits her own head.
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,She thinks it is a very hard cupboard!
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,The Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard.
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,Miss Moppet ties up her head in a duster and sits before the fire.
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,The Mouse thinks she is looking very ill.
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,He comes sliding down the bellpull.
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,Miss Moppet looks worse and worse.
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,The Mouse comes a little nearer.
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,Miss Moppet holds her poor head in her paws and looks at him through a hole in the duster.
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,The Mouse comes VERY close.
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,And then all of a sudden--Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,"And because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet--Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse, which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet."
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,She ties him up in the duster and tosses it about like a ball.
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,But she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it-- there was no Mouse!
Potter,the_story_of_miss_moppet,He has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on top of the cupboard!
