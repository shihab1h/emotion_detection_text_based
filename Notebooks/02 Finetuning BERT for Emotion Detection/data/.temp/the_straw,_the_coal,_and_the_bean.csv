Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","Then the straw began and said: ""Dear friends, from whence do you come here?"""
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","The coal replied: ""I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been burnt to ashes."""
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","The bean said: ""I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades."""
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","""And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?"" said the straw."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","""The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","I luckily slipped through her fingers."""
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","""But what are we to do now?"" said the coal."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","""I think,"" answered the bean, ""that as we have so fortunately escaped death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and repair to a foreign country."""
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way together."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over it."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ""I will lay myself straight across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge."""
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","The straw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","The straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the stream."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water, and breathed her last."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","It would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her together."
Grimms,"the_straw,_the_coal,_and_the_bean","The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam."
