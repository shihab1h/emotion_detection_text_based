Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar).
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender)."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"He came round the back of the fir- tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Peter was sitting by himself.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"""Peter,"" said little Benjamin, in a whisper, ""who has got your clothes?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Peter replied, ""The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,"" and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Peter said he hoped that it would rain.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: ""Cotton-tail!"
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Little Benjamin said: ""It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree."""
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,It had been sown with lettuces.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"They left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket- handkerchief."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,They took them off the scarecrow.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"There had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Benjamin tried on the tam-o'- shanter, but it was too big for him."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,The lettuces certainly were very fine.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Presently he dropped half the onions.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Presently Peter let the pocket- handkerchief go again.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"They got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,He was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,. . .
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,She sat there for FIVE HOURS.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"He was smoking a pipe of rabbit- tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,He was looking for his son.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,Then he took out his nephew Peter.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up INSIDE the greenhouse, locking the door upon the OUTSIDE."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"When Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat."
Potter,the_tale_of_benjamin_bunny,"Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit- tobacco."
