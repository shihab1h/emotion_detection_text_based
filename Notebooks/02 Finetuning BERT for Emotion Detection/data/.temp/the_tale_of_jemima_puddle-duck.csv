Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to someone else-- ""I have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"You would let them go cold; you know you would!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"""I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself,"" quacked Jemima Puddle-duck."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,She tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,She determined to make a nest right away from the farm.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,She set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart road that leads over the hill.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima Puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"She ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,She flew beautifully when she had got a good start.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"She skimmed along over the treetops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima alighted rather heavily and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting place.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,She rather fancied a tree stump amongst some tall foxgloves.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,He had black prick ears and sandy colored whiskers.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"""Quack?"" said Jemima Puddle- duck, with her head and her bonnet on the one side--""Quack?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,The gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at Jemima--
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"""Madam, have you lost your way?"" said he."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"He had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"She explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting place."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"""Ah! is that so?"
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"Indeed!"" said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at Jemima."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,He folded up the newspaper and put it in his coattail pocket.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"""Indeed!"
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,How interesting!
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,I wish I could meet with that fowl.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,I would teach it to mind its own business!
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"""But as to a nest--there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my woodshed."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"You may sit there as long as you like,"" said the bushy long-tailed gentleman."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the foxgloves."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"""This is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient,"" said the hospitable gentleman."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"There was a tumbledown shed at the back of the house, made of old soap boxes."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,The gentleman opened the door and showed Jemima in.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,The shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"When she came out, the sandy- whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,He was so polite that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for the night.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again the next day.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his woodshed.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima Puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,They were greeny white and very large.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,The foxy gentleman admired them immensely.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not there.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--""and I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"They might catch cold,"" said the conscientious Jemima."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"""Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a treat."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Let us have a dinner party all to ourselves!
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"""May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm garden to make a savory omelet?"
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"I will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelet,"" said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima Puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"She went round the farm garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,And she waddled into the kitchen and got two onions out of a basket.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"The collie dog Kep met her coming out, ""What are you doing with those onions?"
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,He asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"Then he went out, and trotted down the village."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,He went to look for two foxhound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"Jemima Puddle-duck went up the cart road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,He was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air and kept glancing uneasily round the wood.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,When Jemima alighted he quite jumped.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"""Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Give me the herbs for the omelet.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"Be sharp!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,He was rather abrupt.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,She felt surprised and uncomfortable.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,While she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"Someone with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and them locked it."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima became much alarmed.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"A moment afterward there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Presently Kep opened the door of the shed and let out Jemima Puddle- duck.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"He had a bite on his ear, and both the puppies were limping."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima Puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,"She laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched."
Potter,the_tale_of_jemima_puddle-duck,Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter.
