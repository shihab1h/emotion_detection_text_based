Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,Once upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"He was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain, splashing in the pond--"
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"""I will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"""If I catch more than five fish, I will invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"The Alderman, however, eats salad."""
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"Mr. Jeremy put on a mackintosh, and a pair of shiny galoshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"The boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"Mr. Jeremy took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"""I know a good place for minnows,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,Mr. Jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and fastened the boat to it.
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,Then he settled himself cross- legged and arranged his fishing tackle.
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,He had the dearest little red float.
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"The rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"""This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"He punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"""I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,A great big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his galoshes.
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,Once or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"""I trust that is not a rat,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; ""I think I had better get away from here."""
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"Mr. Jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"""A minnow! a minnow!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"I have him by the nose!"" cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,But what a horrible surprise!
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp, the stickleback, covered with spines!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"The stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,Then he jumped back into the water.
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"And a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"And while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat--sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water--a MUCH worse thing happened; a really FRIGHTFUL thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a mackintosh!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"A great big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash-- and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, ""Ow!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,Ow!
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"Ow!""--and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"But the trout was so displeased with the taste of the mackintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's galoshes."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"Mr. Jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"He scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his mackintosh all in tatters."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"""What a mercy that was not a pike!"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"""I have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"He put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder."
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,Sir Isaac Newton wore his black and gold waistcoat.
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,And Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.
Potter,the_tale_of_mr_jeremy_fisher,"And instead of a nice dish of minnows, they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce, which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_ think it must have been nasty!"
