Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,She was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""I've lost my pocket-handkin!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,Three handkins and a pinny!
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Have YOU seen them, Tabby Kitten?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen--
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Sally Henny-penny, have YOU found three pocket-handkins?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little- town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her short legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hillside."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg- cup!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were footmarks of a VERY small person.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Lucie ran on, and on."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,The path ended under a big rock.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,But there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Lily-white and clean, oh!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"With little frills between, oh!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Smooth and hot-red rusty spot Never here be seen, oh!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Lucie knocked-once-twice, and interrupted the song."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"A little frightened voice called out ""Who's that?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams-- just like any other farm kitchen.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap-where Lucie had yellow curls-that little person had PRICKLES!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Who are you?"" said Lucie."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Have you seen my pocket-handkins?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"The little person made a bob- curtsey--""Oh yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear- starcher!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"And she took something out of the clothesbasket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""What's that thing?"" said Lucie- ""that's not my pocket-handkin?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Then she took something else off a clothes-horse--""That isn't my pinny?"" said Lucie."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"It's very bad to wash!"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""There's one of my pocket- handkins!"" cried Lucie--""and there's my pinny!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Oh that IS lovely!"" said Lucie."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Oh that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"She'll very soon go barefoot!"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Why, there's another hankersniff-- but it isn't mine; it's red?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it DID so smell of onions!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out that smell."""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""There's another one of mine,"" said Lucie."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""What are those funny little white things?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself."""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""There's my last pocket-handkin!"" said Lucie."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""And what are you dipping into the basin of starch?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse--most terrible particular!"" said Mrs. Tiggy- winkle."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes."""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""What are these dear soft fluffy things?"" said Lucie."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl."""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Will their jackets take off?"" asked Lucie."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"""Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"They're ALWAYS marked at washing!"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"And she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,Then Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were HAIRPINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"So that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say ""Good-night,"" and to thank the washer-woman.--But what a VERY odd thing!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,She was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown-and her petticoat?
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,And HOW small she had grown-- and HOW brown--and covered with PRICKLES!
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,Why!
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG! * * * * * *
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,"(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile--but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tiggy-winkleMANCORR,And besides--I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells--and besides _I_ am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)
