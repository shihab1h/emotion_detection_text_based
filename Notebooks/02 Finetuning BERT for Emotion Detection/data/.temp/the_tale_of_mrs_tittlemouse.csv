Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Once upon a time there was a woodmouse, and her name was Mrs. Tittlemouse."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,She lived in a bank under a hedge.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Such a funny house!
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to store- rooms and nut cellars and seed cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"There was a kitchen, a parlor, a pantry, and a larder."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Also, there was Mrs. Tittle- mouse's bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Mrs. Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!"" said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering her dustpan."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,And one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Fly away home to your children!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Another day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Go away, you bold bad spider!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice clean house!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,She bundled the spider out at a window.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Mrs. Tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherrystones and thistle- down seed for dinner."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge?"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet."""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble--""Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!"" said the bumble bee."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,She wished that she had a broom.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some bees- wax."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,But what are you doing down here?
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Why do you always come in at a window, and say, Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Mrs. Tittle- mouse began to get cross.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Zizz, Wizz, Wizzz!"" replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,But it was full of untidy dry moss.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Mrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!"" said Mrs. Tittlemouse."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""I will have them turned out --"" ""Buzz!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Buzz!
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Buzzz!""--""I wonder who would help me?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"--""I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet."""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Mrs. Tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"When she got back to the parlor, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"He was sitting all over a small rocking chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""How do you do, Mr. Jackson?"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Deary me, you have got very wet!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"I'll sit awhile and dry myself,"" said Mr. Jackson."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,He sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner?
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,First she offered him cherry- stones.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!"" said Mr. Jackson."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Then she offered him thistle- down seed--""Tiddly, widdly, widdly!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Pouff, pouff, puff."" said Mr. Jackson."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,He blew the thistle- down all over the room.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Now what I really--REALLY should like-- would be a little dish of honey!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""I am afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson!"" said Mrs. Tittlemouse."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"" said the smiling Mr. Jackson, ""I can SMELL it; that is why I came to call."""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dishcloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlor floor."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"When he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,First he squeezed into the pantry.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Tiddly, widdly, widdly?"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,No honey?
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"No honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate rack.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Two of them got away; but the littlest one he caught.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Then he squeezed into the larder.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of visitors!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""And without any invitation!"" said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"They went along the sandy passage--""Tiddly, widdly--"" ""Buzz!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Wizz!
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Wizz!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""I do not like bumble bees."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"They are all over bristles,"" said Mr. Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat sleeve."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Get out, you nasty old toad!"" shrieked Babbitty Bumble."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""I shall go distracted!"" scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,She shut herself up in the nut cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the bees-nest.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,He seemed to have no objection to stings.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out--everybody had gone away.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"But the untidiness was something dreadful--""Never did I see such a mess--smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown--and marks of big and little dirty feet-- all over my nice clean house!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,She gathered up the moss and the remains of the bees- wax.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"She fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,But she was too tired to do any more.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"""Will it ever be tidy again?"" said poor Mrs. Tittlemouse."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,Next morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fort- night.
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with bees- wax, and polished her little tin spoons."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"When it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without Mr. Jackson."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"So they handed him out acorn cupfuls of honeydew through the window, and he was not at all offended."
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"He sat outside in the sun, and said--""Tiddly, widdly, widdly!"
Potter,the_tale_of_mrs_tittlemouse,"Your very good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"""
