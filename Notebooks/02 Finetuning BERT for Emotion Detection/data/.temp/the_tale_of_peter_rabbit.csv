Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were-- Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"""Now, my dears,"" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, ""you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor."""
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"""Now run along, and don't get into mischief."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"I am going out."""
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries;"
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!"
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes;
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!"
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, ""Stop thief."""
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"And rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower- pot."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Presently Peter sneezed-- ""Kertyschoo!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Mr. McGregor was after him in no time,"
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,He went back to his work.
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"After a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all around."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,She only shook her head at him.
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,Peter began to cry.
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"A white cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he has heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"He went back towards the toolshed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe-- scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,Peter scuttered underneath the bushes.
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions.
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!"
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes."
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!"
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"""One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time."""
Potter,the_tale_of_peter_rabbit,"But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper."
