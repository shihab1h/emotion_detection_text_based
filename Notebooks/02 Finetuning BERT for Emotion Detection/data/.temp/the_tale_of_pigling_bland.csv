Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Once upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"She had eight of a family: four little girl pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck, Yock-yock and Spot; and four little boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling Bland, Chin-Chin and Stumpy."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"The eight little pigs had very fine appetites--""Yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they DO eat!"" said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with pride."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Suddenly there were fearful squeals; Alexander had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him out by the hind legs.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Chin-chin was already in disgrace; it was washing day, and he had eaten a piece of soap."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"And presently in a basket of clean clothes, we found another dirty little pig--""Tchut, tut, tut! whichever is this?"" grunted Aunt Pettitoes."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Now all the pig family are pink, or pink with black spots, but this pig child was smutty black all over; when it had been popped into a tub, it proved to be Yock-yock."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,I went into the garden; there I found Cross-patch and Suck-suck rooting up carrots.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Cross-patch tried to bite me.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Aunt Pettitoes, Aunt Pettitoes! you are a worthy person, but your family is not well brought up."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Every one of them has been in mischief except Spot and Pigling Bland."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Yus, yus!"" sighed Aunt Pettitoes."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""And they drink bucketfuls of milk; I shall have to get another cow!"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Good little Spot shall stay at home to do the housework; but the others must go.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Yus, yus, yus,"" said Aunt Pettitoes, ""there will be more to eat without them."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"So Chin-chin and Suck-suck went away in a wheel-barrow, and Stumpy, Yock-yock and Cross- patch rode away in a cart."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"And the other two little boy pigs, Pigling Bland and Alexander went to market."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"We brushed their coats, we curled their tails and washed their little faces, and wished them good bye in the yard."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief, then she wiped Pigling Bland's nose and shed tears; then she wiped Alexander's nose and shed tears; then she passed the handkerchief to Spot."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows--"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Now Pigling Bland, son Pigling Bland, you must go to market."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Take your brother Alexander by the hand.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Mind your Sunday clothes, and remember to blow your nose"" --(Aunt Pettitoes passed round the handkerchief again)--""beware of traps, hen roosts, bacon and eggs; always walk upon your hind legs."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Aunt Pettitoes turned to the other--""Now son Alexander take the hand""--""Wee, wee, wee!"" giggled Alexander--""take the hand of your brother Pigling Bland, you must go to market."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Mind--"" ""Wee, wee, wee!"" interrupted Alexander again."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""You put me out,"" said Aunt Pettitoes--""Observe signposts and milestones; do not gobble herring bones--"" ""And remember,"" said I impressively, ""if you once cross the county boundary you cannot come back."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Alexander, you are not attending."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Here are two licenses permitting two pigs to go to market in Lancashire.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Attend Alexander.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"I have had no end of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling Bland listened gravely; Alexander was hopelessly volatile.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"I pinned the papers, for safety, inside their waistcoat pockets; Aunt Pettitoes gave to each a little bundle, and eight conversation peppermints with appropriate moral sentiments in screws of paper."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Then they started.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling Bland and Alexander trotted along steadily for a mile; at least Pigling Bland did.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Alexander made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He danced about and pinched his brother, singing--"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""This pig went to market, this pig stayed at home, ""This pig had a bit of meat--"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"let's see what they have given US for dinner, Pigling?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling Bland and Alexander sat down and untied their bundles.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Alexander gobbled up his dinner in no time; he had already eaten all his own peppermints--""Give me one of yours, please, Pigling?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""But I wish to preserve them for emergencies,"" said Pigling Bland doubtfully."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Alexander went into squeals of laughter.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Then he pricked Pigling with the pin that had fastened his pig paper; and when Pigling slapped him he dropped the pin, and tried to take Pigling's pin, and the papers got mixed up."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling Bland reproved Alexander.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"But presently they made it up again, and trotted away together, singing--"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Tom, Tom the piper's son, stole a pig and away he ran!"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""But all the tune that he could play, was `Over the hills and far away!'"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""What's that, young Sirs?"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Stole a pig?
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Where are your licenses?"" said the policeman."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,They had nearly run against him round a corner.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland pulled out his paper; Alexander, after fumbling, handed over something scrumply--"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""To 2 1/2 oz. conversation sweeties at three farthings""--""What's this? this ain't a license?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Alexander's nose lengthened visibly, he had lost it."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""I had one, indeed I had, Mr. Policeman!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""It's not likely they let you start without."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,I am passing the farm.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"You may walk with me."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Can I come back too?"" inquired Pigling Bland."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""I see no reason, young Sir; your paper is all right."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland did not like going on alone, and it was beginning to rain."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"But it is unwise to argue with the police; he gave his brother a peppermint, and watched him out of sight."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"To conclude the adventures of Alexander--the policeman sauntered up to the house about tea time, followed by a damp subdued little pig."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,I disposed of Alexander in the neighborhood; he did fairly well when he had settled down.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland went on alone dejectedly; he came to cross roads and a sign-post--""To Market-town 5 miles,"" ""Over the Hills, 4 miles,"" ""To Pettitoes Farm, 3 miles."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in Market Town, and tomorrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of Alexander."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He glanced wistfully along the road towards the hills, and then set off walking obediently the other way, buttoning up his coat against the rain."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He had never wanted to go; and the idea of standing all by himself in a crowded market, to be stared at, pushed, and hired by some big strange farmer was very disagreeable--"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""I wish I could have a little garden and grow potatoes,"" said Pigling Bland."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He put his cold hand in his pocket and felt his paper, he put his other hand in his other pocket and felt another paper--Alexander's!"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling squealed; then ran back frantically, hoping to overtake Alexander and the policeman."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He took a wrong turn--several wrong turns, and was quite lost."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"It grew dark, the wind whistled, the trees creaked and groaned."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland became frightened and cried ""Wee, wee, wee!"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"I can't find my way home!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"After an hour's wandering he got out of the wood; the moon shone through the clouds, and Pigling Bland saw a country that was new to him."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"The road crossed a moor; below was a wide valley with a river twinkling in the moonlight, and beyond --in misty distance--lay the hills."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside --""I am afraid it IS a hen house, but what can I do?"" said Pigling Bland, wet and cold and quite tired out."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Bacon and eggs, bacon and eggs!"" clucked a hen on a perch."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle!"" scolded the disturbed cockerel."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""To market, to market! jiggettyjig!"" clucked a broody white hen roosting next to him."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland, much alarmed, determined to leave at daybreak."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"In the meantime, he and the hens fell asleep."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,In less than an hour they were all awakened.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"The owner, Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson, came with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowls to take to market in the morning."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He grabbed the white hen roosting next to the cock; then his eye fell upon Pigling Bland, squeezed up in a corner."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He made a singular remark--""Hallo, here's another!"" --seized Pigling by the scruff of the neck, and dropped him into the hamper."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Then he dropped in five more dirty, kicking, cackling hens upon the top of Pigling Bland."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"The hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight; it was taken down hill, unsteadily, with jerks."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling, although nearly scratched to pieces, contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside his clothes."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"At last the hamper was bumped down upon a kitchen floor, the lid was opened, and Pigling was lifted out."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He looked up, blinking, and saw an offensively ugly elderly man, grinning from ear to ear."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""This one's come of himself, whatever,"" said Mr. Piperson, turning Pigling's pockets inside out."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He pushed the hamper into a corner, threw a sack over it to keep the hens quiet, put a pot on the fire, and unlaced his boots."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland drew forward a coppy stool, and sat on the edge of it, shyly warming his hands."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Mr. Piperson pulled off a boot and threw it against the wainscot at the further end of the kitchen.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"There was a smothered noise--""Shut up!"" said Mr. Piperson."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland warmed his hands, and eyed him."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Mr. Piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first, there was again a curious noise-- ""Be quiet, will ye?"" said Mr. Piperson."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling Bland sat on the very edge of the coppy stool.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Mr. Piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge, it seemed to Pigling that something at the further end of the kitchen was taking a suppressed interest in the cooking; but he was too hungry to be troubled by noises."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Mr. Piperson poured out three platefuls: for himself, for Pigling, and a third-after glaring at Pigling-- he put away with much scuffling, and locked up."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling Bland ate his supper discreetly.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"After supper Mr. Piperson consulted an almanac, and felt Pigling's ribs; it was too late in the season for curing bacon, and he grudged his meal."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Besides, the hens had seen this pig."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He looked at the small remains of a flitch [side of bacon], and then looked undecidedly at Pigling."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""You may sleep on the rug,"" said Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling Bland slept like a top.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,In the morning Mr. Piperson made more porridge; the weather was warmer.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He looked how much meal was left in the chest, and seemed dissatisfied--""You'll likely be moving on again?"" said he to Pigling Bland."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Before Pigling could reply, a neighbor, who was giving Mr. Piperson and the hens a lift, whistled from the gate."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Mr. Piperson hurried out with the hamper, enjoining Pigling to shut the door behind him and not meddle with nought; or ""I'll come back and skin ye!"" said Mr. Piperson."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"It crossed Pigling's mind that if HE had asked for a lift, too, he might still have been in time for market."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,But he distrusted Peter Thomas.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"After finishing breakfast at his leisure, Pigling had a look round the cottage; everything was locked up."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,He found some potato peelings in a bucket in the back kitchen.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling ate the peel, and washed up the porridge plates in the bucket."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,He sang while he worked--
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Tom with his pipe made such a noise, He called up all the girls and boys-- ""And they all ran to hear him play, ""Over the hills and far away!--"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Suddenly a little smothered voice chimed in--
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Over the hills and a great way off, The wind shall blow my top knot off."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland put down a plate which he was wiping, and listened."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"After a long pause, Pigling went on tiptoe and peeped round the door into the front kitchen; there was nobody there."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"After another pause, Pigling approached the door of the locked cupboard, and snuffed at the keyhole."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,It was quite quiet.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"After another long pause, Pigling pushed a peppermint under the door."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,It was sucked in immediately.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,In the course of the day Pigling pushed in all his remaining six peppermints.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"When Mr. Piperson returned, he found Pigling sitting before the fire; he had brushed up the hearth and put on the pot to boil; the meal was not get-at-able."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Mr. Piperson was very affable; he slapped Pigling on the back, made lots of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,He did lock the cupboard door; but without properly shutting it.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He went to bed early, and told Pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o'clock."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland sat by the fire, eating his supper."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"All at once at his elbow, a little voice spoke--""My name is Pig-wig."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Make me more porridge, please!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland jumped, and looked round."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"She had twinkly little screwed up eyes, a double chin, and a short turned up nose."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"She pointed at Pigling's plate; he hastily gave it to her, and fled to the meal chest--""How did you come here?"" asked Pigling Bland."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Stolen,"" replied Pig-wig, with her mouth full."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling helped himself to meal without scruple.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""What for?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Bacon, hams,"" replied Pig- wig cheerfully."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Why on earth don't you run away?"" exclaimed the horrified Pigling."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""I shall after supper,"" said Pig- wig decidedly."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling Bland made more porridge and watched her shyly.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"She finished a second plate, got up, and looked about her, as though she were going to start."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""You can't go in the dark,"" said Pigling Bland."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pig-wig looked anxious.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Do you know your way by day- light?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""I know we can see this little white house from the hills across the river."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Which way are _you_ going, Mr. Pig?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""To market--I have two pig papers."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"I might take you to the bridge; if you have no objection,"" said Pigling much confused and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pig- wig's gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,He was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"She became quiet, and there was a smell of peppermint."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""I thought you had eaten them?"" said Pigling, waking suddenly."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Only the corners,"" replied Pig- wig, studying the sentiments with much interest by the firelight."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""I wish you wouldn't; he might smell them through the ceiling,"" said the alarmed Pigling."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pig-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket; ""Sing something,"" she demanded."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""I am sorry."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,. .
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"I have tooth- ache,"" said Pigling much dismayed."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Then I will sing,"" replied Pig- wig, ""You will not mind if I say iddy tidditty?"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"I have forgotten some of the words."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland made no objection; he sat with his eyes half shut, and watched her."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"She wagged her head and rocked about, clapping time and singing in a sweet little grunty voice--"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""A funny old mother pig lived in a stye, and three little piggies had she; ""(Ti idditty idditty) umph, umph, umph! and the little pigs said wee, wee!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"She sang successfully through three or four verses, only at every verse her head nodded a little lower, and her little twinkly eyes closed up--"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Those three little piggies grew peaky and lean, and lean they might very well be; ""For somehow they couldn't say umph, umph, umph! and they wouldn't say wee, wee, wee!"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""For somehow they couldn't say--"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pig-wig's head bobbed lower and lower, until she rolled over, a little round ball, fast asleep on the hearth-rug."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling Bland, on tiptoe, covered her up with an antimacassar."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,He was afraid to go to sleep himself; for the rest of the night he sat listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of Mr. Piperson overhead.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Early in the morning, between dark and daylight, Pigling tied up his little bundle and woke up Pig- wig."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,She was excited and half- frightened.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""But it's dark!"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"How can we find our way?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""The cock has crowed; we must start before the hens come out; they might shout to Mr. Piperson."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pig-wig sat down again, and commenced to cry."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Come away Pig-wig; we can see when we get used to it."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Come!
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"I can hear them clucking!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling had never said shuh! to a hen in his life, being peaceable; also he remembered the hamper."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,He opened the house door quietly and shut it after them.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,There was no garden; the neighborhood of Mr. Piperson's was all scratched up by fowls.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,They slipped away hand in hand across an untidy field to the road.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Tom, Tom the piper's son, stole a pig and away he ran!"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""But all the tune that he could play, was `Over the hills and far away!'"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Come Pig-wig, we must get to the bridge before folks are stirring."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Why do you want to go to market, Pigling?"" inquired Pig-wig."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"The sun rose while they were crossing the moor, a dazzle of light over the tops of the hills."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"The sunshine crept down the slopes into the peaceful green valleys, where little white cottages nestled in gardens and orchards."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""That's Westmorland,"" said Pig- wig."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"She dropped Pigling's hand and commenced to dance, singing-- presently."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""I don't want; I want to grow potatoes."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Have a peppermint?"" said Pig-wig."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling Bland refused quite crossly.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Does your poor toothy hurt?"" inquired Pig- wig."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling Bland grunted.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pig-wig ate the peppermint herself, and followed the opposite side of the road."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Pig-wig! keep under the wall, there's a man ploughing."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pig-wig crossed over, they hurried down hill towards the county boundary."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Suddenly Pigling stopped; he heard wheels.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Slowly jogging up the road below them came a tradesman's cart.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"The reins flapped on the horse's back, the grocer was reading a newspaper."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Take that peppermint out of your mouth, Pig-wig, we may have to run."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Don't say one word.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Leave it to me.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"And in sight of the bridge!"" said poor Pigling, nearly crying."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He began to walk frightfully lame, holding Pig-wig's arm."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"The grocer, intent upon his newspaper, might have passed them, if his horse had not shied and snorted."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He pulled the cart crossways, and held down his whip."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Hallo?"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Where are you going to?""--Pigling Bland stared at him vacantly."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Are you deaf?"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Are you going to market?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling nodded slowly.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""I thought as much."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,It was yesterday.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Show me your license?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pigling stared at the off hind shoe of the grocer's horse which had picked up a stone.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"The grocer flicked his whip-- ""Papers?"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pig license?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Pigling fumbled in all his pockets, and handed up the papers."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"The grocer read them, but still seemed dissatisfied."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""This here pig is a young lady; is her name Alexander?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Pig-wig opened her mouth and shut it again; Pigling coughed asthmatically.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"The grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his newspaper--""Lost, stolen or strayed, 10S. reward;"" he looked suspiciously at Pig-wig."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Then he stood up in the trap, and whistled for the ploughman."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""You wait here while I drive on and speak to him,"" said the grocer, gathering up the reins."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"He knew that pigs are slippery; but surely, such a VERY lame pig could never run!"
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Not yet, Pig-wig, he will look back."""
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,The grocer did so; he saw the two pigs stock-still in the middle of the road.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Then he looked over at his horse's heels; it was lame also; the stone took some time to knock out, after he got to the ploughman."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"""Now, Pig-wig, NOW!"" said Pigling Bland."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,Never did any pigs run as these pigs ran!
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,They raced and squealed and pelted down the long white hill towards the bridge.
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"Little fat Pig- wig's petticoats fluttered, and her feet went pitter, patter, pitter, as she bounded and jumped."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"They ran, and they ran, and they ran down the hill, and across a short cut on level green turf at the bottom, between pebble beds and rushes."
Potter,the_tale_of_pigling_bland,"They came to the river, they came to the bridge--they crossed it hand in hand--then over the hills and far away she danced with Pigling Bland!"
