Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called Timmy Tiptoes."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Timmy Tiptoes sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and chuckled--""Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store for winter and spring."""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch--""The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter."""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in spring- time,"" replied prudent Timothy."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"When Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other squirrels were there already."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away quietly by themselves.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,Every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"They carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"When these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree, that had belonged to a woodpecker; the nuts rattled down--down--down inside."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""How shall you ever get them out again?"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"It is like a money box!"" said Goody."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""I shall be much thinner before springtime, my love,"" said Timmy Tiptoes, peeping into the hole."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,They did collect quantities-- because they did not lose them!
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot remember the place."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"He began to dig, and he could not remember."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,And then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"And other squirrels began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion!"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Unfortunately, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"There were several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"The first one sang--""Who's bin digging-up MY nuts?"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Who's-been- digging-up MY nuts?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"And another sang--""Little bita bread and-NO-cheese!"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Little bit-a- bread an'-NO-cheese!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,The squirrels followed and listened.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"The first little bird flew into the bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and it sang--""Who's-bin digging-up MY nuts?"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little bird did not expect an answer."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"It was only singing its natural song, and it meant nothing at all."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"But when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"The innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a fright!"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting-- ""Who's-been digging-up MY-nuts?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"They caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the little round hole, and they pushed him in."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,The hole was much too small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they did not break his ribs."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""We will leave him here till he confesses,"" said Silvertail Squirrel and he shouted into the hole--""Who's- been-digging-up MY-nuts?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Timmy Tiptoes made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,He lay quite stunned and still.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,Goody Tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,She made a cup of tea for Timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,Next morning she ventured back to the nut bushes to look for him; but the other unkind squirrels drove her away.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"She wandered all over the wood, calling--"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""Timmy Tiptoes!"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,Timmy Tip- toes!
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,In the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"He found himself tucked up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it seemed to be under ground."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better?"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its nightcap; and the house was full of provisions.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"The Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree--""Besides, I found a few buried!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to eat quantities --""But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin myself?"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"My wife will be anxious!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""Just another nut--or two nuts; let me crack them for you,"" said the Chipmunk."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and fatter!
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,Now Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"She hid them under a tree root; they rattled down, down, down."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""It is getting perfectly full-up downstairs; the sitting room is full, and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has run away and left me."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not know that anybody lived here,"" said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; ""but where is Chippy Hackee?"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"My husband, Timmy Tiptoes, has run away too."""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""I know where Chippy is; a little bird told me,"" said Mrs. Chippy Hackee."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"She led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Down below there was a noise of nutcrackers, and a fat squirrel voice and a thin squirrel voice were singing together--"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""My little old man and I fell out, How shall we bring this matter about?"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Bring it about as well as you can, And get you gone, you little old man!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""You could squeeze in, through that little round hole,"" said Goody Tiptoes."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""Yes, I could,"" said the Chipmunk, ""but my husband, Chippy Hackee, bites!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang--
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"""For the diddlum day Day diddle durn di!"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Day diddle diddle dum day!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Then Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down--""Timmy Tiptoes!"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Oh fie, Timmy Tiptoes!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"And Timmy replied, ""Is that you, Goody Tiptoes?"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Why, certainly!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,He came up and kissed Goody through the hole; but he was so fat that he could not get out.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down below and chuckled."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"And so it went on for a fort- night; till a big wind blew off the top of the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"But Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was uncomfortable."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,At last a large bear came walking through the wood.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,Perhaps he also was looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,Chippy Hackee went home in a hurry!
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"And when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his head; and he was more uncomfortable still."
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,And now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut store fastened up with a little padlock.
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"And whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he sings--""Who's-been-digging- up MY-nuts?"
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,"Who's been dig- ging-up MY-nuts?"""
Potter,the_tale_of_timmy_tiptoes,But nobody ever answers!
