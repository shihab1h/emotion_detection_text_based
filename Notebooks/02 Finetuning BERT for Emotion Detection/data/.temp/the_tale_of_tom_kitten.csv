Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"Once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,But one day their mother--Mrs.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"Tabitha Twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet).
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,Then she brushed their fur (this one is Mittens).
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,Then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is Tom Kitten).
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"Tom was very naughty, and he scratched."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,His mother sewed them on again.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"""Now keep your frocks clean, children!"
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,You must walk on your hind legs.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"Keep away from the dirty ash- pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pigsty and the Puddle- ducks."""
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,When they stood up there were several green smears!
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"""Let us climb up the rockery and sit on the garden wall,"" said Moppet."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,They turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns and shedding buttons right and left."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat, paddle pat! and the three Puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step-- pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!"
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,They stopped and stood in a row and stared up at the kittens.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,They had very small eyes and looked surprised.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"""Come!"
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"Mr. Drake Puddle-duck,"" said Moppet."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"""Come and help us to dress him!"
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"Come and button up Tom!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,Mr. Drake Puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner and picked up the various articles.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,But he put them on HIMSELF!
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"""It's a very fine morning!"" said Mr. Drake Puddle-duck."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!"
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"""My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted,"" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,She sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles-- which was not true.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,Quite the contrary; they were not in bed: NOT in the least.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"Somehow there were very extra-- ordinary noises overhead, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten!"
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,As for the Puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons."
Potter,the_tale_of_tom_kitten,"And Mr. Drake Puddle-duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since."
