Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"Once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll's-house; it was red brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"It belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"Jane was the Cook; but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"There were two red lobsters and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some pears and oranges."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,One morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,Tom Thumb was a mouse.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"A minute afterwards, Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,The doll's-house stood at the other side of the fire-place.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearthrug.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,They pushed the front door--it was not fast.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining-room.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,Then they squeaked with joy!
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table!
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"There were tin spoons, and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs--all SO convenient!"
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"It was a beautiful shiny yellow, streaked with red."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"""It is not boiled enough; it is hard."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"You have a try, Hunca Munca."""
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"Hunca Munca stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another lead knife."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"""It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's,"" said Hunca Munca."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"The ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"""Let it alone,"" said Tom Thumb; ""give me some fish, Hunca Munca!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,Hunca Munca tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the dish.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,Then Tom Thumb lost his temper.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"He put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel--bang, bang, smash, smash!"
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster!"
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,Then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears and the oranges."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,Tom Thumb went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top-- there was no soot.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"While Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another disappointment."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labelled-- Rice--Coffee--Sago--but when she turned them upside down, there was nothing inside except red and blue beads."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,Then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could--especially Tom Thumb!
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"He took Jane's clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top floor window."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather bed."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"With Tom Thumbs's assistance she carried the bolster downstairs, and across the hearth-rug."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse- hole; but they managed it somehow.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"Then Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a book-case, a bird- cage, and several small odds and ends."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,The book-case and the bird- cage refused to go into the mousehole.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"Hunca Munca left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"Hunca Munca was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,What a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda!
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared; and Jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled--but neither of them made any remark.
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"The book-case and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal- box--but Hunca Munca has got the cradle, and some of Lucinda's clothes."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"She also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"The little girl that the doll's-house belonged to, said,--""I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"But the nurse said,--""I will set a mouse-trap!"""
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"So that is the story of the two Bad Mice,--but they were not so very very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,"He found a crooked sixpence under the hearth-rug; and upon Christmas Eve, he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and Jane."
Potter,the_tale_of_two_bad_mice,And very early every morning-- before anybody is awake--Hunca Munca comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!
