Grimms,the_turnip,There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and the other poor.
Grimms,the_turnip,"The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so, pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well, and sowed turnips."
Grimms,the_turnip,"When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for there never was such a one seen before, and never will again."
Grimms,the_turnip,"At last it was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it would be a blessing or a curse to him."
Grimms,the_turnip,"One day he said to himself, ""What shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect."""
Grimms,the_turnip,"Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it to the king."
Grimms,the_turnip,"""What a wonderful thing!"" said the king; ""I have seen many strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw."
Grimms,the_turnip,Where did you get the seed? or is it only your good luck?
Grimms,the_turnip,"If so, you are a true child of fortune."""
Grimms,the_turnip,"""Ah, no!"" answered the gardener, ""I am no child of fortune; I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground."
Grimms,the_turnip,"I have a brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me."""
Grimms,the_turnip,"The king then took pity on him, and said, ""You shall be poor no longer."
Grimms,the_turnip,"I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother."""
Grimms,the_turnip,"Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so rich that his brother""s fortune could not at all be compared with his."
Grimms,the_turnip,"When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself."
Grimms,the_turnip,"However, he determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip, what must his present be wroth?"
Grimms,the_turnip,"The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him."
Grimms,the_turnip,"When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his brother."
Grimms,the_turnip,"So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ""Dear brother, I have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between us."""
Grimms,the_turnip,"The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree."
Grimms,the_turnip,"But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away."
Grimms,the_turnip,"Meantime he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out his head."
Grimms,the_turnip,"When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow, who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went."
Grimms,the_turnip,"As soon as the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ""Good morning! good morning to thee, my friend!"""
Grimms,the_turnip,"The student looked about everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came from, cried out, ""Who calls me?"""
Grimms,the_turnip,"Then the man in the tree answered, ""Lift up thine eyes, for behold here I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great and wondrous things."
Grimms,the_turnip,"Compared to this seat, all the learning of the schools is as empty air."
Grimms,the_turnip,"A little longer, and I shall know all that man can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind."
Grimms,the_turnip,"Here I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones."
Grimms,the_turnip,"Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel and own the power of knowledge."
Grimms,the_turnip,"The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said, ""Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to let me into the sack for a little while?"""
Grimms,the_turnip,"Then the other answered, as if very unwillingly, ""A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to me."""
Grimms,the_turnip,"So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith, for his thirst for knowledge was great."
Grimms,the_turnip,"Then the other pretended to give way, and said, ""Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter."""
Grimms,the_turnip,"So the student let him down, opened the sack, and set him free."
Grimms,the_turnip,"""Now then,"" cried he, ""let me ascend quickly."""
Grimms,the_turnip,"As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ""Wait a while,"" said the gardener, ""that is not the way."""
Grimms,the_turnip,"Then he pushed him in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after wisdom dangling in the air."
Grimms,the_turnip,"""How is it with thee, friend?"" said he, ""dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee?"
Grimms,the_turnip,"Rest there in peace, till thou art a wiser man than thou wert."""
Grimms,the_turnip,"So saying, he trotted off on the student""s nag, and left the poor fellow to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down."
