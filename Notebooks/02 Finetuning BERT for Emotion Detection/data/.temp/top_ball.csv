HCAndersen,top_ball,"A WHIPPING TOP and a little ball lay together in a box, among other toys, and the top said to the ball, ""Shall we be married, as we live in the same box?"""
HCAndersen,top_ball,"But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather, and thought as much of herself as any other young lady, would not even condescend to reply."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"The next day came the little boy to whom the playthings belonged, and he painted the top red and yellow, and drove a brass-headed nail into the middle, so that while the top was spinning round it looked splendid."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""Look at me,"" said the top to the ball."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""What do you say now?"
HCAndersen,top_ball,Shall we be engaged to each other?
HCAndersen,top_ball,"We should suit so well; you spring, and I dance."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"No one could be happier than we should be."""
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""Indeed! do you think so?"
HCAndersen,top_ball,"Perhaps you do not know that my father and mother were morocco slippers, and that I have a Spanish cork in my body."""
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""Yes; but I am made of mahogany,"" said the top."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""The major himself turned me."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"He has a turning lathe of his own, and it is a great amusement to him."""
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""Can I believe it?"" asked the ball."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""May I never be whipped again,"" said the top, ""if I am not telling you the truth."""
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""You certainly know how to speak for yourself very well,"" said the ball; ""but I cannot accept your proposal."
HCAndersen,top_ball,I am almost engaged to a swallow.
HCAndersen,top_ball,"Every time I fly up in the air, he puts his head out of the nest, and says, 'Will you?' and I have said, 'Yes,' to myself silently, and that is as good as being half engaged; but I will promise never to forget you."""
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""Much good that will be to me,"" said the top; and they spoke to each other no more."
HCAndersen,top_ball,Next day the ball was taken out by the boy.
HCAndersen,top_ball,"The top saw it flying high in the air, like a bird, till it would go quite out of sight."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"Each time it came back, as it touched the earth, it gave a higher leap than before, either because it longed to fly upwards, or from having a Spanish cork in its body."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"But the ninth time it rose in the air, it remained away, and did not return."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"The boy searched everywhere for it, but he searched in vain, for it could not be found; it was gone."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""I know very well where she is,"" sighed the top; ""she is in the swallow's nest, and has married the swallow."""
HCAndersen,top_ball,"The more the top thought of this, the more he longed for the ball."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"His love increased the more, just because he could not get her; and that she should have been won by another, was the worst of all."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"The top still twirled about and hummed, but he continued to think of the ball; and the more he thought of her, the more beautiful she seemed to his fancy."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"Thus several years passed by, and his love became quite old."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"The top, also, was no longer young; but there came a day when he looked handsomer than ever; for he was gilded all over."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"He was now a golden top, and whirled and danced about till he hummed quite loud, and was something worth looking at; but one day he leaped too high, and then he, also, was gone."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"They searched everywhere, even in the cellar, but he was nowhere to be found."
HCAndersen,top_ball,Where could he be?
HCAndersen,top_ball,"He had jumped into the dust-bin, where all sorts of rubbish were lying: cabbage-stalks, dust, and rain-droppings that had fallen down from the gutter under the roof."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""Now I am in a nice place,"" said he; ""my gilding will soon be washed off here."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"Oh dear, what a set of rabble I have got amongst!"""
HCAndersen,top_ball,"And then he glanced at a curious round thing like an old apple, which lay near a long, leafless cabbage-stalk."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"It was, however, not an apple, but an old ball, which had lain for years in the gutter, and was soaked through with water."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""Thank goodness, here comes one of my own class, with whom I can talk,"" said the ball, examining the gilded top."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""I am made of morocco,"" she said."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""I was sewn together by a young lady, and I have a Spanish cork in my body; but no one would think it, to look at me now."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"I was once engaged to a swallow; but I fell in here from the gutter under the roof, and I have lain here more than five years, and have been thoroughly drenched."
HCAndersen,top_ball,"Believe me, it is a long time for a young maiden."""
HCAndersen,top_ball,"The top said nothing, but he thought of his old love; and the more she said, the more clear it became to him that this was the same ball."
HCAndersen,top_ball,The servant then came to clean out the dust-bin.
HCAndersen,top_ball,"""Ah,"" she exclaimed, ""here is a gilt top."""
HCAndersen,top_ball,"So the top was brought again to notice and honor, but nothing more was heard of the little ball."
HCAndersen,top_ball,He spoke not a word about his old love; for that soon died away.
HCAndersen,top_ball,"When the beloved object has lain for five years in a gutter, and has been drenched through, no one cares to know her again on meeting her in a dust-bin."
